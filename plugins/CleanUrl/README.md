Clean Url (plugin for Omeka)
============================


Summary
-------

This plugin allows to have clean, readable and search engine optimized URLs like
http://example.com/my_collection/dc:identifier instead of
http://example.com/items/show/internal_code.

A main path can be added before collection names, as "collections" or "library":
http://example.com/main_path/my_collection/dc:identifier.

A generic and persistent url for all items can be used too, for example
http://example.com/record/dc:identifier.

For more information on Omeka, see [Omeka][1].


Installation
------------

Uncompress files and rename plugin folder "CleanUrl".

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin and follow the config instructions.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It's always recommended to backup your database so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
